# Reading View Enhancer plugin for Obsidian

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that enhances the reading experience in preview mode
by adding a "collapse indicator" selector. Use arrow keys to select next/previous "collapse indicator" and
fold/unfold easily.

> ðŸ“Œ Commands are only available if the current active view is in a **reading(preview)** mode.

## Known Issues

- [ ] **Dynamically loaded collapse indicators - not selectable**

Looks like reading view uses some kind of dynamic loading.
I update the list of **"selectable" collapse indicators** whenever there is a change in DOM. So if some collapse indicators are removed from the DOM by dynamic loading, it means that they are not selectable anymore.

- [ ] Invisible, but selectable metadata(frontmatter)

I didn't consider the `Settings > Editor > Show Frontmatter: false` option.
Since I check the 'is-collapsed' class for collapse indicator selection, the invisible collapse indicator has become selectable.

- [ ] Lack of knowledge about plugin development

Actually, I didn't read the [docs](https://marcus.se.net/obsidian-plugin-docs/) much. I'm on reading now!

## Features

- `Reading View Enhancer: Activate selector`
  - Start using the "collapse indicator" selector
- `Reading View Enhancer: Deactivate selector`
  - Turn back to default reading view by deactivating the selector
  - By default, `Esc` deactivates the selector
- Use arrow keys to interact with "collapse indicator"s
  - `Arrow Up`: Select previous "collapse indicator"
  - `Arrow Down`: Select next "collapse indicator"
  - `Arrow Left & Right`: Toggle fold/unfold"
- Click to select nearest "collapse indicator" from clicked position

> Note that the change of a focus deactivates the selector.
